# Random Quotes Project
Welcome to the "Random Quotes" project! This project is built using HTML and CSS, as well as asynchronous functions to interact with the API, and is a simple but fun table with a quote and a button to request a new quote.
## How the project works
The Random Quotes project gives you the ability to get random quotes from various sources. Each time you click on the "New Quote" button, a request to the API is made and a new clever, motivational or inspirational quote appears in the tableau. You can enjoy the wise words and update the quote as many times as you want!
